# Powershell
This repository is made to hold various powershell scripts made by me.
The first script committed is a script that pulls the DHCP leases from a given DHCP server and outputs the results to a .csv file to "C:\scripts\DHCP_Leases.csv"
The script will prompt for a DHCP server to be named.
